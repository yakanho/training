### Intro

Working with "dig" and understanding its outputs are crucial for DNS troubleshooting and debugging, so don't be shy and ask questions to learn the maximum. 

> [!TIP]
>
> We can't explore all dig possibilities during this workshop. We do recommend you to continue playing to learn this fantastic tool.



### Goals

1. Become familiar with the use of dig
2. Use dig to retrieve and examine DNS ressource records
3. Interpret dig's output and identify some common DNS problems.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Commands preceded with "$" imply that you should execute the command as a general user - not as root.
> Commands preceded with "#" imply that you should be working as root.
> Commands with more specific command lines (e.g. “rtrX>" or “mysql>") imply that you are executing commands on remote equipment, or within another program.



### The dig Tool

The tool “*dig*” was originally shipped with BIND and is commonly found on many Unix-like platforms. It stands for *Domain Information Groper*. It collects data about Domain Name Servers and is helpful for troubleshooting DNS problems and/or displaying DNS information.

Other DNS implementations also include similar tools, often with similar names (e.g. kdig). Older tools used for DNS troubleshooting include *nslookup* and *host*.

A manual page for dig can be found here or from the command-line. There are a lot of available parameters. You can ignore most of them while you are getting started.

```
$ man dig
```

A typical invocation of dig looks like:

```
dig @SERVER NAME TYPE
```

- **SERVER**: name or IP address of the name server to query. If no server argument is provided, dig consults /etc/resolv.conf. If no usable addresses are found, dig will send the query to the local host.
- **NAME**: name of the resource record that is to be looked up.
- **TYPE**: type of query requested (A, MX, NS, SIG, ...). If no type supplied, dig will lookup for an A record.



For each dig query sent, a response is expected with different sections. Here are few of them:

* The first line displays the version of the dig command.
* The **HEADER** section shows the information it received from the server. **Flags** refer to the answer format and they are extremely important to understand the overall result of the query. There are six (06) flags: 

	1. **AA**: Authoritative Answer
	2. **TC**: Truncated Response
	3. **RD**: Recursion Desired
	4. **RA**: Recursion Available
	5. **AD**: Authentic Data
	6. **CD**: Checking Disabled
* The **OPT PSEUDOSECTION** displays advanced data such as EDNS (Extension mechanisms for DNS), if used.
* The **QUESTION** section displays the query data that was sent.
* The **ANSWER** section: probably the most important section for the user.
* The **STATISTICS** section shows metadata about the query: 
   * query time (amount of time to get the response); 
   * SERVER (IP address and port of the responding DNS server); 
   * WHEN (timestamp when the command was run); 
   * MSG SIZE rcvd (size of the response packet from the DNS server).


### Sending DNS Queries Using dig

Try using dig to query the IPv4 address corresponding to www.icann.org. Here are various ways of doing that; what differences do you see in the output from each of them?

```
$ dig www.icann.org A
$ dig www.icann.org A
$ dig @8.8.8.8 www.icann.org A
$ dig @1.1.1.1 www.icann.org A
```

For each answer that you got, discuss the different section of the answer with the facilitators. You will be surprised to see that dig tool provides a sea of information.

Now try other records

```
$ dig NS icann.org
```

```
$ dig SOA ricta.org.rw
```

```
$ dig www.ricta.org.rw A
```

```
$ dig @8.8.8.8 www.ricta.org.rw A
```

```
$ dig SOA ricta.org.rw @ns1.ricta.org.rw.
```


Again, try to discuss the various outputs with your instructors.

### Let's continue exploring dig tool with its following options

* **+short**: to display only the queried resource record value

```
$ dig @8.8.8.8 www.icann.org A +short
```

* **+noall +answer**: to get detailed information of the answers section only

```
$ dig @8.8.8.8 www.icann.org A +noall +answer
```

* **+trace**: lists each different server the query goes through to its final destination. Good for troubleshooting

```
$ dig www.icann.org A +trace
```

* **-x**: to lookup a domain name by its IP address (**reverse lookup**)

```
$ dig -x 192.0.47.7
```

* **-f**: to look up multiple entries stored in a file

```
$ echo "icann.org google.com gmail.com" > test_batch_lookup.txt ; dig -f test_batch_lookup.txt +short
```

* **hostname.bind**: to retrieve the hostname of the server (if allowed to)

```
$ dig CHAOS txt hostname.bind @ns.icann.org.
$ dig txt hostname.bind @d.root-servers.net CHAOS
```

* **id.server**: 

```
$ dig txt ID.SERVER @d.root-servers.net CHAOS
$ dig txt ID.SERVER @9.9.9.9 CHAOS
```

* **version.bind**: BIND servers respond to queries for name version.bind with record type TXT and class CHAOS. By default, this is set to the version of BIND that has been installed

```
$ dig CHAOS txt version.bind @ns.icann.org.
$ dig txt version.bind @d.root-servers.net CHAOS
```



### Using dig to get DNSSEC information

* Getting the resource record signatures (RRSIG) for signed domains: 

```
$ dig www.icann.org A +dnssec
```

```
$ dig icann.org NS +dnssec
```

Compare the number of RRSIG you get in the first case to the number you received in the second case.

You can add the `+multi` option to make the results more "readable".

* Retrieve the public keys for the zone: they are stored in a specific resource record type named "DNSKEY"

```
$ dig icann.org DNSKEY
```

You can mix the known options such as redirecting to a specific name server, adding multilign option, etc.

* Retrieve the delegation signer info for the zone: they are stored in a specific resource record type named "DS"

```
$ dig icann.org DS
```
